This directory contains build scripts for Deliberation RuleML
There are two top-level build scripts:
* build_myng.sh : this builds the generated RNC and XSD locally and tests it against local test suites
* build_web.sh : (under development) this builds the generated RNC and XSD from the cload and tests it against cloud-stored test suites

These scripts call incremental build scripts which can be manually activated for partial builds.
See the top-level build scripts for details.
