# This module declares the following RuleML choice pattern:
#            * termsPlus.sequence

## In unary logics, a positional argument sequence has exactly zero or one positional arguments.
termsForAtoms.nonemptysequence.choice |= positionalArgument-edge.choice, positionalArgument-edge.choice?
termsForExpressions.nonemptysequence.choice |= positionalArgument-edge.choice, positionalArgument-edge.choice?
