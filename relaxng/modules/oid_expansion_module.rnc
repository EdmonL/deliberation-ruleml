#            * <oid>

## an extension point for stripe skipping as well as specializations of the object identifier tag name.  
objectIdentifier-edge.choice |= oid.edge.def

## An optional object identifier for an atomic formula, expression or the unifed terms
##  of the SWSL branch, as needed for PSOA semantics. 
## Note that oids are not required to be unique within a rulebase.

## The object descriptor content model consists of any single term.
## Note: this corrects an error in the oid content model of RuleML 1.0,
## where Var is allowed in oid in bindatagroundlog and bindatagroundfact.
