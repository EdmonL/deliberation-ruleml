# This module extends the following RuleML choice patterns:
#            * body_Implies
#            * head_Implies

# All the RuleML roles below are made collapsible by allowing
# substitution of their content model for the role pattern.

# 
#        *** <if> , <then> ***

## In implications, both stripes may be skipped at the same time.
