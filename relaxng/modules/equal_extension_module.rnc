# This module declares the following RuleML elements and attributes:
#            * <Equal>
#            * <lhs>
#            * <rhs>
#            * <oriented>

## an extension point for alternate spellings and internationalization of the equation tag name.

Equal.Node.def =
    # An equational formula consisting of two expressions, each of which contains an argument and may be optionally surrounded 
    # by a left (<left>) or a right (<right>) role.
    #        See http://www.ruleml.org/1.0/glossary/#gloss-Equal
    
    ## The children of the equation element are divided into two sections, a header section for modifiers, and a main section for the formulas on either side of the equation. 
    element Equal { Equal.attlist, Equal.header, Equal.main }

## Equations accept the header pattern of fuzzifiable formulas.
Equal.header &= SimpleFormula.header?
# For the declaration of the simple formula header, see the atomic formula module (atom_backbone_module).

## Equations contain a pair of terms, a left-hand side and a right-hand side.
Equal.main |= leftSide-edge.choice, rightSide-edge.choice

## an extension point for stripe skipping as well as alternate spellings and internationalization of the left-hand side tag name in equations.

    ## The left-hand side of an equation (<Equal>).
    ##        See http://www.ruleml.org/1.0/glossary/#gloss-left
    element lhs { lhs.content }

## The left-hand side role in an equation is filled by a term.

    ## The right-hand side of an equation (<Equal>).
    ##        See http://www.ruleml.org/1.0/glossary/#gloss-right
